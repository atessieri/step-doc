STEP Redis is a specialized component of the STEP (Safer Transport for Europe Platform) ecosystem that
provides Redis stream integration for transport-related event processing. It enables real-time data
streaming and processing capabilities for transportation events, facilitating high-throughput and
low-latency communication between various components of intelligent transport systems.

Key Features
============

* **Redis Stream Integration**: Seamless connectivity with Redis for high-performance data streaming
* **Asynchronous Processing**: Handle transport events asynchronously for improved system responsiveness
* **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in error handling and recovery mechanisms
* **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle growing volumes of transport events
* **Pub/Sub Capabilities**: Support for publish-subscribe communication patterns
* **Configurable Consumer Groups**: Flexible event consumption strategies for different use cases

Purpose
=======

The STEP Redis module serves as a critical infrastructure component for real-time transport event 
processing. Its main purposes include:

* Enabling high-throughput, low-latency communication for transport events
* Providing a reliable messaging backbone for distributed transportation applications
* Supporting temporal analysis of transport data streams
* Facilitating real-time decision making for intelligent transport systems
* Bridging communication between various STEP ecosystem components

Getting Started
===============
