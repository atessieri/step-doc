========
Overview
========

The STEP Cloud Schemas project provides a standardized way to define and validate 
data structures used in cloud-based STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product model data) 
implementations.

Key Features
============

* JSON Schema definitions for STEP data structures
* Validation tools for ensuring data compliance
* Easy integration with cloud services and APIs

Purpose
=======

This project aims to:

    * Standardize data exchange in cloud-based manufacturing systems
    * Enable interoperability between different STEP-compatible services
    * Provide a robust validation framework for STEP data
    * Simplify the integration of STEP data in modern cloud architectures

Getting Started
===============
