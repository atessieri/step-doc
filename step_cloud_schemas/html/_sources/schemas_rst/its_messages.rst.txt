ITS Messages
============

The ITS messages are the messages that are exchanged between the different components 
of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) system. These messages are used to share 
information about the environment, traffic conditions, and other relevant data between 
vehicles, infrastructure, and other entities in the system.
These JSON schemas define the structure and validation rules for the ITS messages 
used in the system. 
The messages supported are as follows:

    * **CAM**: Defines the structure for Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) 
      used in the ITS system
    * **DENM**: Defines the structure for Decentralized Environmental Notification 
      Messages (DENM) used in the ITS system
