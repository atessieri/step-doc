STEP Producer Schema
====================

The STEP Producer schema defines the structure for messages incoming of STEP 
Producer subsystem. The messages are received from:

    * STEP Client subsystem: DENM messages.
    * STEP Crash Prediction: the events forecasted with the station involved
      with relative position at the current time.

The schema consists of 2 main parts:

    * Header: Contains the metadata of the message like:
        
        * event id
        * source of the event
        * type of the event
        * time
        * data content type
        * name of the data field schema
    
    * Data: Contains the data of the message. This version includes:

        * :doc:`DENM Data V1 Schema <denm_data_v1_schema>` received from STEP Client subsystem
        * Station Collision Array v1 Schema received from STEP Crash Prediction subsystem

This schema defines a JSON Schema **version 1**. For further information, please refer 
to the python classes.

  :language: JSON

Example of the Station Collision Array version 1 message:

.. literalinclude:: ../schemas_examples/cloud_events_step_producer_v1_schema_station_collision_array_v1_schema.json
  :language: JSON
