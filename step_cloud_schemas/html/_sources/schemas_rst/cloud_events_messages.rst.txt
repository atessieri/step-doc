Cloud Events Messages
=====================

Events are everywhere. However, event producers tend to describe events differently.
The lack of a common way of describing events means developers are constantly re-learning 
how to consume events. This also limits the potential for libraries, tooling and 
infrastructure to aid the delivery of event data across environments, like SDKs, event routers
or tracing systems. The portability and productivity that can be achieved from event data is 
hindered overall.

*Cloud Events* is a specification for describing event data in common formats to provide 
interoperability across services, platforms and systems.
Event Formats specify how to serialize a CloudEvent with certain encoding formats. 
Compliant *Cloud Events* implementations that support those encodings MUST adhere to the encoding 
rules specified in the respective event format. All implementations MUST support the JSON format.

For more information on the history, development and design rationale behind the specification, 
see the :xref:`Cloud Events`.

The project follow the CloudEvents specification :xref:`Cloud Events JSON Format`. 

This section describes the structure of **incoming messages** in every subsystem of the STEP Cloud system.
The schemas are following:

    * **STEP Adapter schema**: defines the structure of incoming messages of STEP Adapter subsystem.
    * **STEP Client schema**: defines the structure of incoming messages of STEP Client subsystem.
    * **STEP Producer schema**: defines the structure of incoming messages of STEP Producer subsystem.
    * **STEP Crash Prediction schema**: defines the structure of incoming messages of STEP Crash Prediction subsystem.
