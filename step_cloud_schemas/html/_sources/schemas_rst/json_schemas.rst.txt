JSON Schemas
============

This section contains the JSON schemas that define the structure and validation 
rules for cloud event messages used inside the STEP Cloud and outside. The schemas 
ensure data consistency and provide a contract for message formats across 
different components of the system.

JSON Schemas Groups
-------------------

JSON schemas are organized into the following groups:

    * **Cloud Events Messages**: Defines the structure for message following the 
      CloudEvents specification (:xref:`Cloud Events`)
    * **ITS Messages**: Defines the structure for ITS (Intelligent Transport 
      Systems) system

Message validation is performed against these schemas to ensure data integrity.
All required fields and data types are explicitly defined.
