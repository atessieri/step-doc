Step Producer Schema
====================

The Step Producer schema defines the structure for messages incoming of Step 
Producer subsystem. The messages are received from:

    * Step Client subsystem: DENM messages.
    * Step Avoidance Collision: the events forecasted with the station involved
      with relative position at the current time.

The schema consists of 2 main parts:

    * Header: Contains the metadata of the message like:
        
        * event id
        * source of the event
        * type of the event
        * time
        * data content type
        * name of the data field schema
    
    * Data: Contains the data of the message. This version includes:
        
        * DENM Data V1 Schema

This schema defines a JSON Schema **version 1**. For further information, please refer 
to the python classes.
