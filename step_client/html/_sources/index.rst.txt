The STEP Client package provides a robust interface for communicating with the STEP (Safer Transport for Europe Platform) ecosystem.
It serves as a bridge between the STEP MQTT broker and Redis streams, facilitating the efficient exchange of
Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) messages such as CAM (Cooperative Awareness Messages), DENM (Decentralized
Environmental Notification Messages), CPM (Cooperative Perception Messages) and VAM (Vehicle Awareness Messages).

Key Features
------------

* Secure MQTT communication with SSL/TLS support
* Bidirectional message conversion between MQTT and Redis streams
* Support for CloudEvents format for standardized message exchange
* Asynchronous operation with non-blocking I/O
* Configurable connection parameters
* Comprehensive error handling and logging
* Quality of Service (QoS) controls for reliable message delivery

Purpose
-------

The primary purpose of the STEP Client is to enable seamless integration between ITS components by:

* Acting as a gateway for subscribing to and publishing messages to the STEP broker
* Managing message queuing through Redis streams
* Converting between raw messages and CloudEvents format
* Providing a standardized approach to ITS message processing in distributed systems

Getting Started
---------------
