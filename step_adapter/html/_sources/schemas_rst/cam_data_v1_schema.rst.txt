CAM Data V1 Schema
==================

The CAM (Cooperative Awareness Message) Data Schema defines the structure for status information 
used in C-ITS system. This schema captures essential data including:

    * Station information and identification
    * Position and altitude data with confidence levels
    * Vehicle kinematics (speed, heading, acceleration)
    * Vehicle physical characteristics (length, width)
    * Dynamic parameters (curvature, yaw rate)
    * Vehicle role and drive direction

This schema defines a JSON Schema **version 1**. For further information, please refer 
to the python classes. 

Example of the message:
