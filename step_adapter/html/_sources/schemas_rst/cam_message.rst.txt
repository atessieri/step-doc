CAM Message
===========

Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) are messages exchanged in the ITS network between ITS-Ss 
to create and maintain awareness of each other and to support cooperative performance of vehicles 
using the road network. A CAM contains status and attribute information of the originating ITS-S. 
For ITS-Ss the status information includes time, position, motion state, activated systems, 
etc. and the attribute information includes data about the dimensions, actor type and role in the 
road traffic, etc. On reception of a CAM the receiving ITS-S becomes aware of the presence, type, 
and status of the originating ITS-S. The received information can be used by the receiving ITS-S 
to support several ITS applications. For example, by comparing the status of the originating ITS-S 
with its own status, a receiving ITS-S is able to estimate the collision risk with the
originating ITS-S and if necessary may inform the driver of the vehicle via HMI or in-vehicle system.
