Overview
========

Safer Transport for Europe Platform (STEP) is the Vodafone cooperative mobility solution
that helps road users and road operators to make mobility safer, more secure and accessible.
The package is a Python native library to interact with the STEP MQTT broker using ITS packets.
The MQTT broker is a part of the STEP project, which is a project funded by
the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and Italian PNRR and innovation programme.


Key Features
------------

* Publish ITS Etsi messages to the STEP MQTT broker
* Subscribe to specific topics to receive ITS Etsi messages
* Support for CAM (Cooperative Awareness Message) and DENM (Decentralized Environmental Notification Message) messages
* Conversion between ITS packets and JSON format
* Both synchronous (non-blocking) and asynchronous (coroutine) communication approaches
* Secure communication with TLS support
* Message format conversions between JSON, ORM, and Dictionary
* Proper connection handling and cleanup utilities


Purpose
-------

This project aims to:

* Facilitate communication with the STEP MQTT broker
* Convert ITS packets to JSON format and vice versa
* Provide a Python native library for V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communications
* Enable developers to easily implement MQTT-based messaging for intelligent transport systems
* Support both synchronous and asynchronous programming models


Getting Started
---------------

To begin using the STEP Library, refer to the :doc:`installation<installation>`
section and :doc:`step usage<step_usage>` section.

Before using the library, ensure you have:

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Valid STEP broker credentials
* Basic understanding of MQTT communication principles
