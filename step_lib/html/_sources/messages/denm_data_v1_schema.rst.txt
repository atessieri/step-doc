DENM Data V1 Schema
===================

The DENM (Decentralized Environmental Notification Message) schema defines the structure for messages used 
in C_ITS communication to notify about road events and hazards. The schema consists of several main containers:

- **Action ID**: Uniquely identifies the DENM through originatingStationId and sequenceNumber
- **Management Container**: Contains basic event management data including:
  - Detection and reference times
  - Geographic position and validity information
  - Station type and transmission parameters

- **Situation Container**: Describes the type and quality of the detected event
- **Location Container**: Provides detailed positioning information about the event
- **PreCrash Container**: Contains specific data related to potential collision scenarios, including:
  - Perceived object details
  - Time to collision
  - Impact section information
  - Estimated braking distance

This schema defines a JSON Schema **version 1**. For further information, please refer 
to the python classes.
