==================
CAM Data V1 Schema
==================

The CAM (Cooperative Awareness Message) Data Schema defines the structure for vehicle status information 
used in C-ITS system. This schema captures essential vehicle data including:

* Station information and identification
* Position and altitude data with confidence levels
* Vehicle kinematics (speed, heading, acceleration)
* Vehicle physical characteristics (length, width)
* Dynamic parameters (curvature, yaw rate)
* Vehicle role and drive direction

This schema defines a JSON Schema **version 1**. For further information, please refer 
to the python classes.
