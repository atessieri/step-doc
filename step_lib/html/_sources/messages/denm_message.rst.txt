DENM Message
============

The Decentralized Environmental Notification service (DEN) is an application support functionality operating at the
facilities layer. The DEN service is responsible for the generation of DEN Messages (DENMs) based on received
triggering information from applications. It is also responsible for the processing of received DENMs from other C-ITS
stations. The DEN service is especially suited for the exchange of event based safety related information. The DENM
information is mainly used by ITS applications in order to alert road users of a detected event using ITS communication
technologies. DENM is used to describe a variety of events that can be detected by ITS Stations (ITS-S).
The dissemination of DENM by an ITS-S is operated by DENM protocol.

The general processing procedure of an ITS use case that is supported by the DENM protocol is as follows:

* Upon detection of an event, an ITS-S transmits DENMs in order to disseminate the information about this
  event to other ITS-Ss located inside a destination area. The ITS-S that generates the DENM is denoted as
  originating ITS-S.
* DENM transmission is initiated and terminated by an ITS-S application at the ITS application layer.
* The transmission of a DENM may be repeated.
* DENM transmission may persist as long as the event is present.
* An ITS-S may forward a DENM. This ITS-S is denoted as forwarding ITS-S.
* The termination of DENM transmission is either automatically achieved by the facilities layer, i.e. the DEN
  service of the originating ITS-S when a predefined expiry time is reached, or by an ITS-S application that
  requests the generation of a DENM to inform that the event has terminated.
* An ITS-S, which receives a DENM, processes the information and may decide to present an appropriate
  warning or information to user, as long as the information in the received DENM is relevant to the ITS-S. This
  ITS-S is denoted as receiving ITS-S.
